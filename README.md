## React Generic Quiz

A Quiz built with React.
Change the **questions.json** file to add or remove questions.

The focus of this project was to build a "on brand" frontend design that could scale based on the JSON file provided.

No CSS libraries were used. Branding was used to guide design decisions.

**Hosted on Firebase:**

<!-- ## Further Build Ideas
1. Make questions.json come from a mongodb
2. Add a more detailed results page with scoring.

Allow people to add a title / secondary info / logo. Like personalized quizes.
private vs public quizes
allow to get wrong vs. keep quessing until correct.

3. Make a frontend to allow users to generate quizes.
4. Make an admin page to review how quiz takers did.
