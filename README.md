## React Generic Quiz

A Quiz built with React. Change the questions.json file to add or remove questions. The frontend supports as many questions as you want based on the JSON file.

The focus of this project was to build a clean frontend design that could scale based on the JSON file provided.

Hosted on Firebase:
[Live Project Demo](https://apple-quizlet.web.app/).

<!-- ## Further Build Ideas
1. Make questions.json come from a mongodb
2. Add a more detailed results page with scoring.

Allow people to add a title / secondary info / logo. Like personalized quizes.
private vs public quizes
allow to get wrong vs. keep quessing until correct.

3. Make a frontend to allow users to generate quizes.
4. Make an admin page to review how quiz takers did.
